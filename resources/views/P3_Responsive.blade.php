                            <p class="text-info small">Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.</p>
                            <p class="text-info small">Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from jsDelivr when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
